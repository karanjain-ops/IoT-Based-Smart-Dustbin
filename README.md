# IoT Based Smart Dustbin
Ultrasonic Distance Sensors interfaced with Arduino UNO for automatic lid opening and closing and for garbage capacity monitoring.

### Working
One of the Ultrasonic Distance sensors is used automatically open lid using a servo motor when a person is in its proximity while the other is 
used to constantly measure the level of garbage in the bin and automatically detects if it is about to fill up and notified the owner through
the buzzer.
